# SNOW-CRASH

This repository contains my work on the Snow Crash project, an introduction to cybersecurity challenges where each level required discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities to progress to the next step.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to:
- Understand and exploit system vulnerabilities.
- Develop problem-solving skills to bypass various security restrictions.
- Master tools like SSH, SCP, and scripting to automate or simplify tasks.
- Demonstrate autonomy and logical thinking to overcome roadblocks.

Each level corresponds to a specific challenge, where I had to retrieve a password to log into the next account (flagXX) using a variety of techniques.

## **Project Description**

In this project, I worked through multiple levels, each requiring me to exploit system vulnerabilities in order to obtain a password for the next level's account. The challenges tested my ability to:  
- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in various systems.  
- Use tools like **SSH**, **SCP**, and command-line techniques to bypass restrictions.  
- Develop logic and problem-solving skills for real-world security scenarios.
